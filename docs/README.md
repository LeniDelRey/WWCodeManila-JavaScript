# Women Who Code Manila JavaScript Group

![JavaScript](./_media/logo-javascript.png)

**JavaScript** is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. (from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction)

It was invented in 1995 to add dynamic components to websites, and it has been the backbone of the interactive web ever since. Nowadays, it can also be used for many other things, including:

- [serving a website](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- writing [desktop](https://electronjs.org/) and [mobile](https://phonegap.com/) applications
- [controlling robots and smart devices](https://cylonjs.com/)
- [automating your desktop](http://robotjs.io/)
- [visualizing data](https://d3js.org/)
- [creating games](https://www.babylonjs.com/)

We use Mozilla Foundation's [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript) as our main reference because Mozilla is the official manager of JavaScript and because this documentation is more oriented towards developers rather than ECMAScript's [really long PDF file](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf).
